 * Editing rules for the long-form guide:
 * - Never claim the app distinguishes rust species, and never turn an

 * - Never claim a chemical cure, dose or brand for any entry.
 * - When a source is still missing, say what is missing instead of filling

    summary:
      'Red-Striped Soft Scale Insect: a sap-sucking pest that builds up on the lower leaves and coats them in sticky honeydew and black mold.',
    conditionLabel: 'Insect pest',
    scientificName: 'Pulvinaria tenuivalvata',
    signs: [
      'Small insects with red stripes, in young and adult stages, on the lower leaves first, then moving upward.',
      'Yellowing leaves, especially toward the base.',
      'Sticky honeydew on the leaf surface.',
      'A black sooty mold growing on the honeydew, which makes the cane look dirty.',
      'Leaves drying and, in a heavy infestation, dying.',
    ],
    whereToLook:
      'The underside of the lower leaves first. Check the underside of each leaf rather than the top, because that is where the colony sits, and sooty mold may not appear until the infestation is already established.',
    impact:
      'The insect removes sap and the mold blocks light, so the plant grows less and stores less sugar. It spreads quickly from field to field, and moving infested planting material is a known way it travels. It is hard to see early, which is why weekly checking matters.',
    prevention: [
      'Check the undersides of lower leaves every week, especially along field edges.',
      'Do not move cane plants or planting material out of an affected block.',
      'Clean tools, boots and clothing after working in an affected field.',
      'Keep grassy weeds and volunteer cane down around field edges.',
      'Protect natural enemies by avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum spraying.',
    ],
    management: [
      'Walk the field every week and look at the undersides of the lower leaves.',
      'Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, including any covered in black mold, as directed locally.',
      'Do not move cane plants or planting material out of an affected block.',
      'Clean tools and footwear after working in an affected area.',
      'Report a suspected infestation to the Sugar Regulatory Administration, the Department of Agriculture, PHILSURIN or your local agriculture officer straight away, because official records and sample testing matter here and the area-wide response matters more than one farm acting alone.',
      'Keep the field edges and grassy weeds under control, because several weeds can host the insect.',
      'Ask the office before any chemical treatment rather than treating on your own.',
    ],
    detail:
      'RSSI was first detected in Pampanga in 2022 and confirmed in parts of Negros in early 2025. It is treated as an area problem, not a single-farm problem: treating one field while the neighbours are infested invites reinvasion, so the Philippine response uses coordinated surveillance and reporting. Natural enemies, including parasitoid wasps and beneficial fungi, already help suppress it, which is one reason repeated broad-spectrum spraying is discouraged. The scientific name is shown as Pulvinaria tenuivalvata, with the spelling still to be confirmed against the SRA brochures.',
